It was a pentium P4 with 128MB RAM and 40GB RAM and cost about 35000 Rupees. A personal computer was still a luxury for any lower middle income family like us. If I am not wrong, it was probably two months of my dad&amp;rsquo;s salary (or maybe more). He never asked me if I made the best use of it. But I always wanted to make something using the computer.</description></item></channel></rss>
