It has been one year since I started using chatGPT as my digital assistant. If I had my brain scanned under an MRI, between last year and now, there would sure be significant changes in the activity pattern.

I don't just use one tool but I use copilot for work, dall-e for images and chatgpt for everything else. So, what are the most significant changes I have noticed?

- My hesitancy to start a seemingly difficult task has reduced. Earlier, I would procrastinate on tasks that seemed difficult. Now, I just start the task and let chatgpt help me with it. I have noticed that chatgpt is able to help me with most of the tasks I throw at it. It is not perfect but it is good enough to get me started. Once I start, I am able to figure out the rest of the task on my own.
- I have become more organized and systematic. Travel plans, shopping lists etc can be created in a matter of seconds. 
- I don't work hard on the tasks that I don't enjoy. I just ask chatgpt to do it for me. I have noticed that chatgpt is able to do most of the tasks that I don't enjoy. I am able to focus on the tasks that I enjoy.
- I used to google and go on a search journey. Now, I ask chatgpt to do that. When in doubt, I ask it to give a good link to the sources so that I can do my own research.
- I am becoming less and less surprised by new technology. The sense of awe is fading away.
- With tools like copilot, I am always trying to look away from the suggestions it is providing if I want to use my creativity. This feels so weird when you know that the AI is already doing a good job but you still want to do it on your own.

Each of those has its merits and issues. Some of the questions I often ask myself:

- The hesitancy to start is easy: As a result, do we simply start doing things that are not even necessary? When the "How to do it?" becomes so easy, the "Why to do it?" becomes more important. I am not sure if I am asking myself that question enough.
- Organizing: If I plan everything, where is the room for spontaneity?
- Tasks that I don't enjoy: If I don't do the tasks that I don't enjoy, how will I ever learn to enjoy them?
- Search journey: In this age of immediate gratification, is it a good thing to get the answers even more quickly? Where does this end? Is it making me more impatient?
- The sense of awe: What would happen when I only believe what is in front of me and get cynical about everything else?
- Creativity: At some point, will I start losing interest in doing things on my own? Will I become a passive consumer of AI generated content?

I don't have answers to these questions. I am just trying to be aware of the changes that are happening to me. I am trying to be aware of the changes that are happening to the world around me. I am trying to be aware of the changes that are happening to the world because of me.

And the last line there was written completely by copilot. All I did was type "I don't". Am I doomed or not!?
